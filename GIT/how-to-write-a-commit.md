# [How to write a commit message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)

Here I left some notes that I want to remember about this amazing blog.

* A well-crafted Git message is the best way to communicate context about a change to fellow developers.
* Re-establish the context of a piece of code is wasteful. We can not avoid it completely, so our efforts should go to reducing it (as much) as possible. Commit messages can do exactly that and as a resul, a commit message shows whether a developers is a good collaborator.


## The seven rules of a great Git commit message

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
6. Wrap the body ad 72 characters
7. Use the body to explain `what` and `why` vs. `how`
